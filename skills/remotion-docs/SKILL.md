Licence note: Remotion is free only for individuals and for-profit companies with 3 or fewer employees. The owner will not buy a Company License. Use Remotion only for the owner's own freelance or personal work, or if the owner confirms the client has 3 or fewer employees; otherwise use motion-reel or hyperframes (Apache-2.0) instead.

This skill teaches you how to discover and read current Remotion documentation.
If this is not relevant, load Remotion Best Practices instead.

## Searching the docs

Use the Algolia search API to find relevant documentation pages:

```
POST https://plsduol1ca-dsn.algolia.net/1/indexes/*/queries?x-algolia-api-key=<ALGOLIA_PUBLIC_SEARCH_KEY>&x-algolia-application-id=PLSDUOL1CA
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

{
  "requests": [
    {
      "query": "<your search query>",
      "indexName": "remotion",
      "params": "attributesToRetrieve=[\"hierarchy.lvl0\",\"hierarchy.lvl1\",\"hierarchy.lvl2\",\"url\"]&hitsPerPage=10"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each hit contains a `url` field pointing to the documentation page.

## Fetching a page as Markdown

Append `.md` to any Remotion docs URL to retrieve its Markdown source (saves tokens):

```
https://www.remotion.dev/docs/use-video-config.md
https://www.remotion.dev/docs/sequence.md
https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/rendermediaonlambda.md
```

## Workflow

1. Search Algolia for the concept or API you need.
2. Pick the most relevant URL(s) from the results.
3. Fetch each URL with the `.md` suffix.
4. Implement using the current documentation rather than memorized API knowledge.
